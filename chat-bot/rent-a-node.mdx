Nodes are like devices running software connected to a blockchain, like Ethereum. They're crucial for cryptocurrencies, used for dApps or bots. Trading Bots, like Maestro, use their own Node for user trading. Choose one of our 'Tiers,' representing node power. These nodes handle various tasks like hosting dApps, Trading Bots, and MEV Bots. Your Tier choice depends on volume and needed power, with the upper tier suitable for MEV Bots.
