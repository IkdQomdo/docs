Our platform offers a range of Servers and Nodes. Before introducing the $HASH ERC-20 token and our Telegram bot, we collaborated with various GPU, CPU, and Node hosting providers. 

After reviewing long-term contracts, we chose an Asia-based provider for all our products. Monthly payments to them started before the ERC-20 token launch, ensuring constant accessibility. Opting for a long-term setup, we cover the entire monthly hosting costs.
